\section{Finitely ambiguous}
%
A big problem for finitely ambiguous is that inside \adscc{s} there can be redistrbution of probabilties,
making \Cref{lem:adscc pr} false.
However, if there are too many redistributions, then there must be a lot of runs getting cut of,
decreasing the uncertainty in $\preach{}$.
