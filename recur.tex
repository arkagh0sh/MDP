\begin{definition}
Define a quasi order \emphdef{$\tord$} on $\bsup{\pdp}$ as
\[
S \tord T
\quad\iff\quad
\text{there exists $x\in (\ac{\times}\sig)^*$ such that
$\delta(S,x) = T$.}
\]
Let \emphdef{$\teq$} to be the equivalence relation defined as
\[
S \teq T
\quad\iff\quad
\text{$S\tord T$ and $T\tord S$.}
\]
\end{definition}

\section{Finitely ambiguous}
%
A big problem for finitely ambiguous is that inside \adscc{s} there can be redistrbution of probabilties,
making \Cref{lem:adscc pr} false.
However, if there are too many redistributions, then there must be a lot of runs getting cut of,
decreasing the uncertainty in $\preach{}$.
